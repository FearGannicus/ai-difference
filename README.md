# AI Difference

This is a test AI project to distinguish the difference between images of cats and dogs using Node/Typescript.

## Getting started, what do we need todo?

1. [Collect a dataset of images of cats and dogs. You will need a large number of images to train your AI model accurately.](#collecting-datasets)

2. [Preprocess the images by resizing them and converting them to a uniform format (such as JPEG).](#preprocess-and-resize-images-into-a-uniform-format)

3. Split the dataset into a training set and a test set. You will use the training set to train your AI model and the test set to evaluate its performance.

4. Use a machine learning library such as TensorFlow.js or Brain.js to train a model using the training set. You can use a convolutional neural network (CNN) for this task, as it is well suited for image classification.

5. Test the model on the test set and evaluate its performance. You can use metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to assess the model's performance.

6. If the model's performance is not satisfactory, you may need to adjust the model's architecture or the training process and try again.

7. When you are satisfied with the model's performance, you can use it to classify new images of cats and dogs in Node.js.

## Collecting datasets.

**There are several places where you can find datasets of images of cats and dogs:**

- Kaggle: Kaggle is a website that hosts a wide range of datasets for machine learning purposes. You can find several datasets of cats and dogs on Kaggle.

- Google Images: You can use the advanced search options in Google Images to search for images of cats and dogs and download them. However, keep in mind that you may need to filter out irrelevant images and ensure that you have a sufficient number of images for your needs.

- Microsoft COCO: The Microsoft COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset contains a large number of images of common objects, including cats and dogs. You can download the dataset from the Microsoft COCO website.

- ImageNet: ImageNet is a large dataset of images that has been widely used for image classification and other machine learning tasks. It contains many images of cats and dogs. You can download the dataset from the ImageNet website.

- Custom dataset: You can also create your own custom dataset by taking pictures of cats and dogs or by using images that you have permission to use. This can be time-consuming, but it can also give you greater control over the quality and diversity of your dataset.

## Preprocess and resize images into a uniform format.

**There are several tools and libraries that you can use to preprocess images and resize them into a uniform format in Node.js:**

1. GraphicsMagick: GraphicsMagick is a powerful image processing library that can be used to resize, crop, and transform images. You can install it using the following command:

```
npm install gm
```

To resize an image using GraphicsMagick, you can use the `resize` method, like this:

```js
const gm = require("gm");

gm("input.jpg")
	.resize(200, 200)
	.write("output.jpg", (error) => {
		if (error) {
			console.log(error);
		} else {
			console.log("Done");
		}
	});
```

2. Sharp: Sharp is a high-performance image processing library that can be used to resize, crop, and transform images. It is based on libvips, which is written in C, and can be faster than other libraries that are written in JavaScript. You can install it using the following command:

```
npm install sharp
```

To resize an image using Sharp, you can use the `resize` method, like this:

```js
const sharp = require("sharp");

sharp("input.jpg")
	.resize(200, 200)
	.toFile("output.jpg")
	.then(() => {
		console.log("Done");
	})
	.catch((error) => {
		console.log(error);
	});
```

3. Jimp: Jimp is an image processing library that is simple to use and can be used to resize, crop, and transform images. It is written in JavaScript and does not require any external dependencies. You can install it using the following command:

```
npm install jimp
```

To resize an image using Jimp, you can use the `resize` method, like this:

```js
const Jimp = require("jimp");

Jimp.read("input.jpg")
	.then((image) => {
		return image.resize(200, 200).write("output.jpg");
	})
	.then(() => {
		console.log("Done");
	})
	.catch((error) => {
		console.log(error);
	});
```
